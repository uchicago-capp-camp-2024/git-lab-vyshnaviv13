Like yesterday's lab, today's lab will ask you to take some steps with Git and run a `check.py` script as you go.

Additionally, today you'll be submitting at the end via Gradescopeâ€”a tool used in many classes.

Don't worry, we won't be grading your work; submitting is merely to help you get acquainted with tools you'll be using in many classes.

## Part 1 - Making a First Commit

Whenever you have made a change that you wish to keep, you'll make a Git commit.

Open up 'part1.txt' using `code` and answer the questions.

When you've done so, add a commit with the message "part 1 done!"

Run `python3 check.py 1` to check that your commit exists and is correct.

Note: If the check is still not passing, run `git log` and confirm that your commit message was, in fact, "part 1 done!". If you accidentally made a typo, make an empty Git commit with the correct spelling, as follows:

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "part 1 done!"
```

Then reattempt the check.

## Part 2 - Making & Reverting Changes with `git restore`

Open up the file 'part2.txt' and make the modifications it describes. (Do not commit them yet!)

Run the command `python3 check.py 2` which will verify that these changes are made.

Once you've run this command, undo the changes using `git restore` and run `python3 check.py 2` again.

## Part 3 - Viewing Changes with `git diff`

Run the command `python3 changes.py` this will make some changes to your local files, but will not commit them. (Do not commit them either!)

Then take a look at these changes with `git diff`, open up `part3.txt` and answer the questions based on the changes you see.

Be sure to commit your changes! There is no `check.py` step for this part.

## Part 4 - Finding a Change in the `git log`

The answer to part 4 is in the git history. Use `git log` to find the commit in question.

You'll see that each commit has a hash, like 'de8e74bc2c3ec106554440021efd1ec6808486c2'. These uniquely identify each commit.

Once you find it, you can use `git show <hash-id>` to show what changed in that commit.

**Tip:** If you are typing hashes instead of copying and pasting, you can type the first four or more characters instead of the entire thing.

Use `git log` and `git show` to discover what used to be in the `secret` file and add this text to `part4.txt`. Use `python3 check.py 4` to confirm.

You can also try this using the GitHub interface which offers an alternative interface to view the log:

Once you complete part 4, add and commit your change to the file.

### A Note About Secrets

Consider what part 4 means for actual secrets, such as a password or other sensitive information.

It is difficult to _actually remove_ sensitive information from a published Git repository.

For this reason, be sure to avoid committing passwords or other information that you wouldn't want someone to see.

## Submitting Your Assignment

Once your assignment is complete, push your code to your GitHub Classroom repository using the command `git push`.  This will sync the code on your remote GitHub branch (`main`) with the code from your current local branch of the same name. Afterwards, navigate to your repository and confirm that the code updates are present. View the commits you made and the files that have changed.

Finally, go to the CAPP Camp [Gradescope course](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/834709) and click on the "Git Lab" assignment.  Follow the instructions there for submitting your repository. An auto-grader will then run and re-execute the `check.py` script.  If you completed the assignment correctly, your code should pass without any errors.
